[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) gathers math and computing problems which often require quite some time and thought.
I have studied problems from this website for years now -- quite irregularly I admit.
I solved my first problem in 2016, as an undergraduate student.
Since then, I solved 112 problems.
In 2020, I ranked among the top 1% of the website members (only counting those that solved at least one problem).

Working on these problems is a similar experience to actual signal processing research.
Many problems are posed in a way that does not indicate which tools to use.
A great part of the job then lies in reframing the question and identifying the math field that can address it.

Many problems involve, among other fields,
number theory,
probability theory,
geometry,
dynamic programming,
or optimization.
As a doctor in signal processing, I particularly enjoy problems involving probability theory, geometry and physics.

Here are 3 selected problems:

- The problem I solved and enjoyed most: [Problem 202: Laserbeam](https://projecteuler.net/problem=202) (difficulty: 60%)
- The hardest problem I solved (according to the website difficulty ranking): [Problem 339: Peredur Fab Efrawg](https://projecteuler.net/problem=339) (difficulty: 70%)
- The problem I did not solve yet and enjoyed most: [Problem 252: Convex Holes](https://projecteuler.net/problem=252) (difficulty: 60%)

and some of my favorite solved problems:

- Problems [81](https://projecteuler.net/problem=81), [82](https://projecteuler.net/problem=82) and [83](https://projecteuler.net/problem=83): shortest path problems with different constraints (respective difficulties: 10%, 20% and 25%)
- [Problem 84: Monopoly Odds](https://projecteuler.net/problem=84) (difficulty: 35%)
- [Problem 144: Investigating multiple reflections of a laser beam](https://projecteuler.net/problem=144) (difficulty: 50%)
- [Problem 267: Billionaire](https://projecteuler.net/problem=267) (difficulty: 50%)
- [Problem 286: Scoring Probabilities](https://projecteuler.net/problem=286) (difficulty: 50%)
- [Problem 317: Firecracker](https://projecteuler.net/problem=317) (difficulty: 35%)
- [Problem 607: Marsh Crossing](https://projecteuler.net/problem=607) (difficulty: 20%)
- [Problem 610: Roman Numerals II](https://projecteuler.net/problem=610) (difficulty: 35%)
