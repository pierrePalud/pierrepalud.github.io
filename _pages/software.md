Up to now, I have built and published two Python packages.

## NNBMA

NNBMA (for Neural Network-Based Model approximation) is a Python package that creates and trains neural networks to approximate complex and slow numerical models.
The goal is then to plug these neural networks in inference schemes, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.

* [Documentation](https://ism-model-nn-approximation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/einigl/ism-model-nn-approximation)
* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nnbma/)

This package was developed in close collaboration with [Lucas Einig](https://einigl.github.io
).

## Beetroots

Beetroots (for BayEsian infErence with spaTial Regularization of nOisy multi-line ObservaTion mapS) is a Python package that performs Bayesian inference of physical parameters from multispectral-structured cubes with a dedicated sampling algorithm. Thanks to this sampling algorithm, beetroots provides maps of credibility intervals along with estimated maps.
